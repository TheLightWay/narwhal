# Basic example

This is the most basic usage of Unicorn possible. I'm assuming that Unicorn has been installed globally using `sudo make install`.

In order to compile your tests, the only thing that you need to do is to use the `-lunicorn` flag. Check out the [`run_tests.c`](https://github.com/vberlier/unicorn/blob/master/examples/basic/run_tests.c) file for a very simple introduction to Unicorn.
